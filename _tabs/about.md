I'm Vulpezzz, a curious mind diving deep into the world of cybersecurity. This site is my personal lab notebook: a place where I document experiments, write-ups, and insights from my journey—CTF walkthroughs, malware dissections, exploit development notes, and the occasional weird detours curiosity drags me into.

I started this space to share what I learn in a hands-on, practical way. I believe that knowledge grows faster when shared, so whether you’re a fellow learner, a teammate, or just someone curious about security, I hope you find something useful, inspiring, or at least entertaining here.

Some of the topics I love exploring and sharing include:

* CTF challenges;
* Malware analysis;
* Exploit development;
* Security tool experiments;
* The little weird tangents curiosity brings;

Cybersecurity is vast, unpredictable, and endlessly fascinating—and this site is my way of navigating, documenting, and sharing that adventure.
