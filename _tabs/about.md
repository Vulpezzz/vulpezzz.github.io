I'm just a normal guy learning cybersecurity and this site is my notebook, a lab where I publish reports, tools, and practical write-ups from the edges of learning: CTF walkthroughs, malware dissections, exploit development notes, tool experiments, and the weird detours curiosity drags me into. I use Arch btw...
